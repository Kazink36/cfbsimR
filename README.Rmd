The goal of cfbsimR is to simulate a college football season and is based on Lee Sharpe's nflseedR package. This was built before the 2022 season and likely needs some adjustment for 2023 and beyond (particularly conference realignment)

## Installation

You can install the development version of cfbsimR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Kazink36/cfbsimR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(cfbsimR)
## basic example code
```
